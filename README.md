# Task 3 - Linear Regression

## 🔍 Objective:
To implement and understand simple & multiple linear regression using Scikit-learn.

## 📁 Dataset:
Housing Price Prediction Dataset from Kaggle:
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

## 📌 Steps Followed:
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Trained Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated model using MAE, MSE, and R² score
6. Plotted Actual vs Predicted prices
7. Displayed model coefficients

## 📊 Evaluation:
- MAE: Measures average error
- MSE: Penalizes larger errors more
- R²: Indicates how well model fits the data

## 📦 Libraries Used:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📌 Learnings:
- Difference between simple and multiple regression
- How to evaluate model performance
- Importance of data preprocessing
